# Aaron's Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This repository will show you the projects and skills that I can provide.

## Web Design

I've gone ahead and taken the modern minimalist path to building my portfolio. Simple and clean.

- Used react one-page design with each component taking full viewport to emphasize each section fully.
- Clear and straightforward visuals.
- Implementing fixed scrolls on each page.
